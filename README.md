I was asked to do this as a coding task for a contract position. It actually presents itself as a nice TDD/OO *kata* (exercise).
I've rewritten these instructions so it won't be so easy to google.

(Personally, I don't have a problem publishing this solution - I think it's a pretty lazy way to do recruitment)

 * The basket is presented as a list of named items. Items can appear multiple times in the list.
 * Each item has a basic cost price.
 * The shop offers discounts - "buy-one-get-one-free" and "three-for-two", on some items.
 * The program should calculate the total cost of the items presented.

e.g.
Apples are 15pm, Bananas are 12p...etc
Apple, Banana, Apple, Melon, Grapefruit
Apples are BOGOFF
...etc
